Hi, I'm Sandra Gross, and I am currently pursuing a Master of Data Science at UBC.
Originally, I am from Germany, where I completed my undergraduate degree in Management & Technology with a specialization in Medicine.
In my free time, I enjoy running, skiing, hiking, and basically all kinds of outdoor activities."
